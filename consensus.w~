@** CrossGov Foundation. This is the consensus algorithm for nodes in a blockchain to agree on a certain value. We are using this algorithm to determine the price of the Big Mac in each unique govermental jurisdiction. This will allow us to create a stable coin that's not pegged to the dollar and isn't beholden to supply and demand volatility because the nodes will issue coin to increase free fleat supply that will stabilize the free float price of the coin.
